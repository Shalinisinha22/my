## Testing the API

### Using Postman
1. Set method to `POST`
2. URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/admin/super-admin`
3. Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
4. Body (raw JSON):
```json
{
  "name": "Test Super Admin",
  "email": "test@ewafashion.com", 
  "password": "TestPass123!"
}
```

### Using cURL
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/super-admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Super Admin",
    "email": "test@ewafashion.com",
    "password": "TestPass123!"
  }'
```

## Next Steps

After creating the super admin:

1. **Login** using the credentials
2. **Create admins** with their own stores
3. **Configure platform settings**
4. **Monitor system-wide operations**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Super admin already exists"**
   - This endpoint can only be used once
   - Use regular admin login instead

2. **"Email already exists"**
   - Choose a different email address
   - Check if admin was already created

3. **Validation errors**
   - Ensure all required fields are provided
   - Check email format
   - Ensure password is at least 6 characters

### Database Reset
If you need to reset and create a new super admin:
```bash
# Clear admin collection (be careful!)
db.admins.deleteMany({})
```
